### How to use

- Make sure to have [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.

- Navigate to the client directory: `cd client/`.
- Run `yarn`.
- Run `yarn dev` (this will start the client).

### To do next

##### Server side

- Add unit testing.
- Add integration testing.
- Currently, we are using SQLite, but for scalability, consider switching to PostgreSQL.
- Currently, we do not have any configuration routes.
  - Configuration should include object type, visibility settings, etc.
- Additionally, consider adding a login page with session management and access rights to restrict unauthorized access.

##### Client side

- Integrate unit testing.
- Improve flow between each page, if necessary.
- Enhance color schemes and frontend design.
- Implement more robust field validation using the Yup library.
- Add quick filtering, sorting, and searching for columns.
- Expand actions for orders:
  - Read-only page/modal with detailed information.
  - Update page/modal.
  - Options for closing, canceling, or finishing work orders.
- Add support for translations into other languages.
- Utilize configurations from the server to build fields dynamically instead of hardcoding them.
